## A React, Java Spring and Hibernate-based Online Food Ordering System
1. Implemented RESTful API via Spring MVC, including registration, menu searching and ordering, and checkout.
2. Utilized Hibernate to access and operate the data storage (menu, restaurants) and set up MySQL instance using AWS RDS.
3. Provided authentication and authorization via Spring security to protect the application from malicious attacks.
4. Used the Spring framework core technologies to decouple all the components in the application loosely.
5. Built the user interface with React and Ant Design to allow users to add items to the shopping cart and place orders. 

To run the code, please make sure to change the datasource information in the ApplicationConfig file.
